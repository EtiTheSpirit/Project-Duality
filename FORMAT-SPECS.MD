# Project Duality Format Specs
This document serves as an information sheet designed to explain what the formats used by Duality store and should be used for.

## Project Duality Knowledge Store (PDKS)
The `*.pdks` extension denotes a knowledge store. Files of this type will store information in a common format, and can be imported into instances to grant it knowledge on whatever may be stored in the file. Likewise, knowledge stores can be exported from instances. Methodology for this has not been designed however, and will be appended to documentation at a later time.

## Project Duality Instance
The `*.pdi` extension denotes an entire instance of AI. Instance is used to describe an AI as a whole, where the information stored in a PDI includes 100% of the knowledge, ideas, and other unique forms of information. As an independent store of this information, the capability to port AI to other devices or create backups/duplicates is readily available.
