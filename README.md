# Project Duality

Project Duality is an AI framework intended primarily for personally learning the fundementals of machine learning. Duality will run on an instance based system. This means that the entirety of an AI's knowledge can be saved to a file and ported to other machines. There will be two major file types used by Duality. You can find information on the formats and what their purpose is on [the format information sheet](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/Project-Duality/blob/master/FORMAT-SPECS.MD).

## The primary goals
These are the goals that I have set for the development of Project Duality

* Duality must provide a modular AI framework that is easy to work with in code.

  * The framework must be specifically designed for an environment of tinkering or any other method of testing, and

  * Include the capability to learn from any source of information defined by the user via provided learning methods that can be expanded upon.

* Run on hardware that may not be viewed as capable of machine learning.

  * And, if applicable, potentially be run on portable devices.
  
* Maintain an energy efficient model that will not introduce extraneous workload on hardware.
