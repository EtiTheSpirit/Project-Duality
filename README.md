Project Duality is an AI intended to serve as a personal learning experience in neural networking in hopes of larger potential for future projects, alongside also serving as a platform for more user-oriented development of intelligence with a modular save/load system.

## The list of goals.

The goals that must be met in order for Project Duality to be deemed successful are ...

* To provide a modular AI framework that is easy to use
 * ...that is also specifically designed for an environment of "tinkering", and
 * is easy to use for people not familiar with the systems of neural networking.
* Run on hardware that may not be viewed as capable of machine learning.
 * And, if applicable, potentially be run on portable devices.
