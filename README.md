Project Duality is an AI intended to serve as a personal learning experience in neural networking in hopes of larger potential for future projects, alongside also serving as a platform for more user-oriented development of intelligence with a modular save/load system.

## The list of goals.

The goals that must be met in order for Project Duality to be deemed successful are ...

1) To provide a modular AI framework that is easy to develop on

1a) ...that is also specifically designed for an environment of "tinkering", and

1b) ...is easy to use on the user-end for people not familiar with the systems of neural networking.

2) Run on hardware that may not be viewed as capable of machine learning.

2a) And, if applicable, potentially be run on portable devices.
